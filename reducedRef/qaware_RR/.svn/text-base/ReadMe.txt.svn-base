This toolbox implements the algorithm described in:

Image Processing, accepted for publication, 2005.

Usage:

1) Download the required files, which include
   (i)   this zip file;
   (ii)  the matlabPyrTools for wavelet analysis (available at 
http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/software.html)
   (iii) Matlab optimization toolbox 

2) Unpack the zip file into a directory, respecting the original
tree structures of the package

3) Set Matlab path to inculde the wavelet analysis routines

4) To test the encoder: run the "test.m" program under directory
qaware_encoder. This results in a quality-aware image named
"qa_img.tif" in the same directory.

5) To test the decoder and quality analyzer: (a) copy "qa_img.tif"
to directory qaware_decoder; (b) run the "test.m" program there.
The "test.m" program simulates several types of distortions and
evaluate the quality of the distorted image.
